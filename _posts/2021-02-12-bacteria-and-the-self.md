From bacteria to societies, is the erasure of one level of self the construction of the next? Thoughts on [Sean Carroll and Michael Levin's conversation](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2021/02/01/132-michael-levin-on-growth-form-information-and-the-self/).

Let me start by saying that the podcast contains a lot of great moments, and that I'll be zooming in on a precise one (timestamp 58:10), paraphrasing a bit:
> SC: At what point to a bunch of [cells] constitute an organism? At what point are they a "self"?  
> ML: There's two aspects; one is how cells come into being, all cognitive agents are made of parts, there's no such thing as this monadic cognitive thing that's not divisible, we are a bag of cells, the question isn't "can cells have goals?" that question has been settled, the only remain question is the scale. How do you scale up from a collection of competent agents to some sort of unified single agent that has a coherent integrated self?   

Michael Levin then goes on, he has model of this which has to do with proto-synapses, and explains a bit how they work. 

> ML: If you imagine two cells coming together and using [these proto-synapses], both cells get access to each other's internal millieu, this means that things that happen to one of the cells very rapidly propagate to the other cell, and all the meta-data as far as who the originator of that information is is stripped. So if something happens to cell A, [like a calcium flux], then all that cell B sees is this flux, is doesn't know whether what triggered it happen to it or to its partner.

That is unlike other stimuli, where the cells know that they are coming "from the environment" (e.g. other cells)

> ML: This has a couple of really critical implications, first, it makes lying or cheating almost impossible, because anything you do to your neighbour is immediately gonna come back to you. [..] It becomes difficult to maintain ownership of individual thought. If you have a [chemical] track record of what happened to you, you can no longer tell which are true memories that you accumulated, and which are false memories that are incepted in your cognitive structure by the fact that they floated in from your neighbour. It's like an amazing form of telepathy, it merges the mind of the two cells into a group agent where they cannot tell what belongs to what, and, I would claim, that is the origin of a simple compound self.

He then goes on to talk about a modified repeated prisonner's dilemma where on of the possible actions is "merge". Once merged, the only "rational" action becomes cooperation, because you don't want to defect against your<it>self</it>.
