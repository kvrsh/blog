I just heard Musa al-Gharbi on Sean Carroll’s [podcast](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/10/19/119-musa-al-gharbi-on-the-value-of-intellectual-diversity/) talk about the value of intellectual diversity.

At one point Sean asks, what are the limits? What viewpoints are too extreme? If they attack my very identity?  
I'm paraphrasing Musa al-Gharbi here; well, it’s a complicated question that should be settled by the intellectuals concerned by it, but consider this: if there’s a significant portion of people and policymakers who hold a given view (even if it really sucks) and you’re going to have to engage with them, then it’s a problem if you say “that’s something I don’t wanna talk about”. 

On fringe views, he says it’s “more safe” to exclude them, but under certain circumstances we should still engage with them anyways.

I’m not sure I agree 100% on the fringe views part, but the “mainstream views” definitely changed my mind somewhat. 
Even if we think a significant portion of people are backwards, racist, we’re not helping ourselves by excluding them (from academic discussion) because then there’s no way to meaningfully and honestly engage with them. Note that I don’t think that this applies to Twitter or Reddit as easily. In academia though, we should be willing to take that step, make that “sacrifice”. 

That being said, that principle may not be true for all `(view, field)` pairs. Holding/debating anti-abortion views in a philosophy department may be fine because it is about engaging. Holding/debating anti-abortion views in a Computer Science department is unhelpful, because CS academics are (a) not trained to even respond to this properly (b) are presumably not experts in anything other than CS (c) didn’t come into CS to make sacrifices about discussing abortion, but maybe rather make sacrifices about discussing internet protocols, TimSort vs KQuickSort, or neural networks vs kernel machines.

[Slavoj Žižek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek), and I'm also paraphrasing here, sometimes says that he rejects the notion that everything should be up for debate. He doesn't want to walk around having to explain to people that rape is bad. It's settled and should be self-evident. It's technicallythetruth<sup>TM</sup> that nothing is self-evident, as no one is the arbiter of truth. I think both these positions are reasonable, and possibly compatible. We should think about the mechanisms under which _anything is up for debate_. We have such mechanisms (albeit imperfect ones) for laws. A person on their own cannot decide to change or select which laws apply to them, but they can (technically[^1]) enter politics and make a case for a law, any law, to be changed.

Would a similar mechanism work for _public_ speech? I mean, probably not. 

I don't think it's crazy to ponder on restrictions of speech when applied to public online speech platforms (and perhaps to an extend to private ones, since the line can sometimes be blurry).

Perhaps a deeper problem is to ask what those "mainstream views" are. Considering recent events (and most of History if we think about it), it's not clear to me that such things exist within Humanity at large. That being said, within small (e.g. academic) communities, that such views exists seems fairly plausible, and healthy.


[^1] there are unfortunately lots of barriers for people to actually enter politics, usually especially people who would benefit the most from political change.
