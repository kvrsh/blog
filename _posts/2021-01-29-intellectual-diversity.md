I just heard Musa al-Gharbi on Sean Carroll’s [podcast](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/10/19/119-musa-al-gharbi-on-the-value-of-intellectual-diversity/).

At one point Sean asks, what are the limits? What viewpoints are too extreme? If they attack my very identity?  
I'm paraphrasing Musa al-Gharbi here; well, it’s a complicated question that should be settled by the intellectuals concerned by it, but consider this: if there’s a significant portion of people and policymakers who hold a given view ([even if it really sucks]) and you’re going to have to engage with them, then it’s a problem if you say “that’s something I don’t wanna talk about”. 

On fringe views, he says it’s “more safe” to exclude them, but under certain circumstances we should still engage with them anyways.

I’m not sure I agree 100% on the fringe views part, but the “mainstream views” definitely changed my mind somewhat. 
Even if we think a significant portion of people are backwards, racist, we’re not helping ourselves by excluding them (from academic discussion) because then there’s no way to meaningfully and honestly engage with them. Note that I don’t think that this applies to Twitter or Reddit as easily. In academia though, we should be willing to take that step, make that “sacrifice”. 

That being said, that principle may not be true for all `(view, field)` pairs. Holding/debating anti-abortion views in a philosophy department may be fine because it is about engaging. Holding/debating anti-abortion views in a Computer Science department is unhelpful, because CS academics are (a) not trained to even respond to this properly (b) are presumably not experts in anything other than CS (c) didn’t come into CS to make sacrifices about discussing abortion, but maybe rather make sacrifices about discussing internet protocols, TimSort vs KQuickSort, or neural networks vs kernel machines.
