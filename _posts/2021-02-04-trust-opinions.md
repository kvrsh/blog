A while ago I came across [this Farnam Street blog post](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/) on the work required to hold an opinion, and it's been bothering me, quietly yanking at my brain.

I think this post argues something interesting, on the surface. It basically argues that we shouldn’t really hold opinions unless we put in the work to understand those opinions, or to sum up:
> The work required to hold an opinion means that you can argue against yourself better than others can.

Let me now proceed to overanalyse this.

There's a few ways to interpret this, let's start with the charitable ones.

If "hold" here means "to defend in a skill-based context like the workplace", then this is fairly valuable advice. Speaking in favor or against something one superficially understands is more often than not a bad gamble.

If "hold" here means "to defend in the public sphere", then things are less obvious. Do I need to be an expert on climate change to defend green policies? An expert on fascism to denounce fascist violence? No. There are clearly situations where we can defend our collective and self-interests without being experts. At the same time, do I need to be an expert on climate change to argue _against_ green policies? Probably. The difference lies in the scientific consensus, another shady thing I could (and probably will) discuss at length.

If "hold" here means "to hold in one's mind" (which I think a naïve reading of the Farnam Street blog prompts), then this is extremely bad advice.

A group/society where everyone held themselves to such a high standard would be quite a dysfunctional chaos of extreme skeptics. The **scale** of our societies and technologies make it impossible for a single person to have enough in-depth knowledge about everything they interact with. Our collective decision-making, from voting to choosing brands at the food market to using the results of a published paper in our own field, requires us to hold more opinions than are verifiable in a lifetime.

Fortunately we have a mechanism for that, trust. Of course trust can be abused. This is perhaps what this article is based on, that we trust “too much”. But what is the logical conclusion of that advice? That, either we shouldn’t trust at all, or that we should trust blindly that about which we did not do the work. They don’t say the latter thing explicitly, but that’s what this implies. **You can’t not have an opinion about certain things**. As in my above example, when buying food, you may not have an “opinion” on either brand X or Y, and choose X “at random”. This choice implies some ethical position, which may **not** be **deliberate**, but exists by **default**.

No opinion still acts as holding an opinion, with the difference that you’re not conscious of it.

A consequentialist reading of this might be the better take. Where and how do your opinions matter? Or, perhaps more interestingly, where does having the default opinion matter?

In Western countries, white privilege often manifests through the default opinion. In science, resistance to new (good) ideas often manifests through the default opinions. You get the idea, what matters is one’s actions, how they affect the world or not, and what (often default) beliefs they are based on.

Me holding a strong unsupported default opinion on anime isn’t a bad thing, because I’m not part of any anime fandom. 

Back to trust. Where do our default beliefs come from? Well, we trust our parents, our friends, and various media (films, shows, etc.). We often entertain parasocial relationships with “famous internet people”. Those aren’t necessarily bad things, because of the scale of the world.

So when should we be wary of our own default beliefs? Well, that is often going to depend on your ethical beliefs. For me, I like to look at the oppressed, the marginalized, those who suffer. I look at them with the assumption that my (default) beliefs may be directly or indirectly causing their condition. There, I can either “do the work”, or simply trust them. 

Some people whine a lot for no reason other than entitlement, but I’ve found that most of the time, it’s simpler to trust people who are telling you that they’re suffering. You don’t even always have to trust what they say: economic stress is often cited as a cause of the rise white nationalism for example, but I trust that they are suffering. This suffering should cause us to reflect on our default beliefs.

Right. I think it’s ok to hold opinions based on trust, it’s good to reflect on them once in a while. It’s necessary to understand which of our beliefs affect the actions that affect the world the most, and to especially reflect (to “do the work”) on those. It's all a fine balance of course.
